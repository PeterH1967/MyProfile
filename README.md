**BACKGROUND INFORMATION** 
 
I am an Australian Citizen, born and raised in Brisbane, Queensland, in a family of ten children. 
My parents were also born in Australia, however my grandparents, came from Wales, England & Ireland. 
I completed Secondary School in Brisbane, but have not completed any tertiary studies. I leaned to 
fly light aircraft many years ago and had dreams of becoming a Qantas 747 Pilot, like my Brother, 
however my life took a different path and I spent many years working in 
Sales/Account Management & Marketing for various industries, including Hospitality, 
Building & Construction and Information Technology. My main hobbies are keeping 
fit and Singing in a band, which I enjoy immensely. 

**INTEREST IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY**

I have always been interested in IT ever since I was young boy, when I used to watch cartoons, 
such as “The Jetsons” and “Dick Tracy”, which were from the 1970’s. It is also interesting 
to note that some of the technology seen in these cartoons is available now. The watch that 
Dick Tracy used to use and the video calls that they used to make in “The Jetsons”. My interest 
in studying IT was inspired when I was contemplating a career change from Sales/Marketing and 
Account Management, in 2019, whilst employed as a National Account Manager for a company 
called, Ezestream, a company that provided Cable TV/Satellite Services, Chromecast, Digital Signage, 
Encryption Services, Internet Services, Interactive Services, IPTV Services, Tablet Solutions 
and Room Automation for Aged Care Facilities, Hotels, Hospitals & Mining Camps, throughout 
the Asia Pacific. In this role, I became more interested in the technical aspect of the role 
as opposed to the Sales & Account Management side of the position. This was a technical 
Account Management role, where I had to liaise between Management and Owners of Hotels, 
Hospitals and Mining Camps and our technical team, which required a high level of 
understand of the technical aspects of the products. 

**WHY CHOOSE RMIT**

Besides teaching me the necessary skills required to work in the IT industry and providing a solid 
basis of technical knowledge, I believe that I will be able to further enhance my skills in 
Communication, Time Management, Problem Solving, Teamwork and Conflict Resolution. Being a 
mature aged student, I understand the importance of being able to work and collaborate with 
other people on projects to provide a successful result.

3. Psychometric Test:
Link: https://www.psychometricinstitute.com.au/report-free.asp?ctid=10451008

**What do the results mean for me?**

I believe that the Myers-Briggs personality test, does reflect my personality accurately. I am driven and 
focused on getting results, I believe that I am a good communicator and have a high level of empathy for 
other people. I believe that I have a natural ability to get people’s confidence quickly and make them feel 
comfortable around me. Over many years, I have also been involved in training and believe that I have the 
patience and understanding to listen to others and their ideas. In my management roles, I have always 
listened to my staff and accepted their judgement and criticisms and used their input to implement changes. 
I would always encourage my staff and provide feedback which would be useful for them in the future endeavors. 
All of these qualities are important to a team environment. 

**How do you think these results may influence my behaviour in a team.**

I have been in the work force since 1985 and have worked in many different working environments and been 
part of many teams focused on various projects and driving them to a successful completion. 
The Myres Brigg personality test does highlight some of the characteristics that I have developed over 
the years, especially my ability to lead, accept responsibility for issues & concerns that have presented 
themselves as well as had a high level of diplomacy and the ability to listen to others and 
their ideas, which will be useful in working in a team for our project.

**How should I take this into account when forming a team?**

As Protagonists are strong personalities, I believe that in my experience with respect to teams of any type, 
if there are too many strong personalities in a group, their will inevitably be clashes, which can often 
create division, making any efforts to create drive a project, can be counter-productive.  In a group situation, 
I would need to look for other group members who would compliment my personality type (ENFJ-A), 
such as an ISFJ, INTP, ESTI or ESFP personality type.

**PROJECT IDEA - BUSINESS TRAVELLER BOOKING APPLICATION**

**Overview**

My idea would be to create a simple app, where you could enter that dates of travel, the destination and the 
times you were easily select the flight, accommodation and rental car required, hit the enter button provide 
credit card details and then email to yourself an itinerary. I would like the app to pull availability 
from websites, such as Webjet / Expedia / Travelocity, hotel.com / bookings.com and the from the respective 
airline websites. I would like the app to be simple to use and all that would be required from the traveler 
is the dates, times looking to travel, number of people traveling and the destination. 

**Motivation**

For many years, I have travelled the world on business and have been, more often than not, responsible for 
coordinating and arranging my own flights, accommodation, rental cars and taxi’s. It was always quite a 
chore to scroll through many websites and individually review the choices with respect to flights, 
accommodation and rental cars. I believe that when arranging travel, unless you are a travel agent, 
there are too many choices for flights, accommodation and rental cars. I believe there needs to be simpler 
way because as stated in business travellers are now more than ever arranging their own travel and as 
stated in the travelperk.com blog,  “business travellers are tech savy and less likely to stick, 
outdated travel policies and methods”

**Description**

As stated in the Travelperk Blog, business travellers, “simply prefer self-booking over the agency route. 
Self-booking lets them collect loyalty points, fly with their favourite airlines, even have the eco-friendly 
option to choose trains over planes.” And the aim of my project idea is to create a simple Mobile Application 
that streamlines the booking process for individuals and business travellers. It will be a simple format that 
will allow the user to enter the basic requirements of the trip, such as the date, destination, standard of 
hotel (1 to 5 stars), preferred location of hotel and flight times which will also provide options for other 
flights around the same time as what has been requested. 

This mobile application will allow the customer to create an account and a profile, which will include, any frequent 
flyer memberships, Hotel & Rental Car Loyalty Program details as well as preferences for hotels, seating position 
requests on flights and preferences for rental vehicles. The customer preferences can be stored and utilized each 
time the member checks in to the mobile application and performs a search for the next business trip. 

This idea would definitely, be useful for the business travellers, however there are several issues which may make 
it difficult to bring it to fruition. It would be simple enough in design, using a number of Mobile Application 
Tools available in the market, however the challenge would be the connectivity to the multitude of hotel, airline 
and rental car booking sites worldwide. It would be more viable to connect with the broader booking engines, 
like Webjet, Bookings.com & Hotels.com etc etc. Also considering the current worldwide situation with Covid 19, 
it would work better to create a product just for the Australian market, as opposed to including the
international market.

The Application will search for availability from the respective search engines, based on the customer requirements 
and deliver to a single platform on the Mobile Application and will provide the customer with a selection of 
options that will suit the business travellers’ requirements. Once the selection has been made from the list 
of flights, accommodation and rental cars, the details are confirmed, respective payment methods processed once 
the details are confirmed, payment can be made via credit card and other payment methods and once payment 
completed an itinerary can be emailed to the traveller. 

With respect to booking hotels & airlines, there are specific booking/cancellation policies that need to be clear 
and concise, to reduce the number of customer service issues that may arise. It is also important for the app 
to provide a live chat and the ability for the consumer to communicate directly in case there are any issues, 
with the online booking process. The application will allow changes and an itinerary email to the customer 
once the entire booking has been completed. The design of the Mobile application has to be simple and easy to 
navigate and not involve to much in the way of the graphics that will slow the site down. It needs to be quick 
and effective and provide itinerary’s will costings that can be used for expense reimbursement purposes.

**Tools & Technologies**

The first plan of action would be to identify an open source software specifically designed for Flight/ Rental 
Cars & Hotels reservations. The software should be able to provide live availability information, have the ability 
to integrate with other platforms and allow multiple people to book using the mobile application, at the one time. 
It should provide the ability to update calendars as well as secure payment methods. To create the booking 
application, you could use software such as, getapp or capterra which assist with application development for 
the travel industry. 

**Skills Required**

The skills required to build an app, require knowledge of programming language, for example, HTML5, Objective-C, 
Swift, C++, C#, and Java. As it will be a live system, a sound knowledge of Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, 
as the application we create will live on the cloud. You will need to create a database for your customers, 
which will mean that a skilled database expert will need to be identified, which will be important to make the 
application run at a rapid speed and with relatively no issues. Security is an important issue that needs to be 
addressed, therefore a person with sound knowledge of security systems, involving the protection of customer 
information and payment methods will be required.  

**Outcome**

The outcome would be a product that will make business & individual travel simpler for the customer. It will cut 
down the amount of time required to make a booking for flights/rental cars & hotels, in real time and that will 
them to make changes and cancel reservations in a few simple steps. When you consider business travel especially, 
how much time is spent going between, business travellers, managerial assistants and travel agents, this will make 
the process quicker and negate the need for a travel agent altogether, reducing costs, allowing the customers to
identify special deals and rates that will in turn save the company money.
