**Background Information** 
 
I am an Australian Citizen, born and raised in Brisbane, Queensland, in a family of ten children. 
My parents were also born in Australia, however my grandparents, came from Wales, England & Ireland. 
I completed Secondary School in Brisbane, but have not completed any tertiary studies. I leaned to 
fly light aircraft many years ago and had dreams of becoming a Qantas 747 Pilot, like my Brother, 
however my life took a different path and I spent many years working in 
Sales/Account Management & Marketing for various industries, including Hospitality, 
Building & Construction and Information Technology. My main hobbies are keeping 
fit and Singing in a band, which I enjoy immensely. 

**Interest in IT**

I have always been interested in IT ever since I was young boy, when I used to watch cartoons, 
such as “The Jetsons” and “Dick Tracy”, which were from the 1970’s. It is also interesting 
to note that some of the technology seen in these cartoons is available now. The watch that 
Dick Tracy used to use and the video calls that they used to make in “The Jetsons”. My interest 
in studying IT was inspired when I was contemplating a career change from Sales/Marketing and 
Account Management, in 2019, whilst employed as a National Account Manager for a company 
called, Ezestream, a company that provided Cable TV/Satellite Services, Chromecast, Digital Signage, 
Encryption Services, Internet Services, Interactive Services, IPTV Services, Tablet Solutions 
and Room Automation for Aged Care Facilities, Hotels, Hospitals & Mining Camps, throughout 
the Asia Pacific. In this role, I became more interested in the technical aspect of the role 
as opposed to the Sales & Account Management side of the position. This was a technical 
Account Management role, where I had to liaise between Management and Owners of Hotels, 
Hospitals and Mining Camps and our technical team, which required a high level of 
understand of the technical aspects of the products.
