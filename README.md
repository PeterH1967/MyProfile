Background Information
 
I am an Australian Citizen, born and raised in Brisbane, Queensland, in a family of ten children. 
My parents were also born in Australia, however my grandparents, came from Wales, England & Ireland. 
I completed Secondary School in Brisbane, but have not completed any tertiary studies. I leaned to 
fly light aircraft many years ago and had dreams of becoming a Qantas 747 Pilot, like my Brother, 
however my life took a different path and I spent many years working in 
Sales/Account Management & Marketing for various industries, including Hospitality, 
Building & Construction and Information Technology. My main hobbies are keeping 
fit and Singing in a band, which I enjoy immensely.
